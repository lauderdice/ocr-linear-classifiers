##How to run the code

first it is necessary to navigate to the directory with the main.py script and create a python virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv

then we have to activate it

    source venv/bin/activate

then we need to install the requirements.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

then we can run the script, which runs all 3 classifiers

    python main.py
